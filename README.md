Responsive Web Design with Sass and Compass training workshop files

## Getting started

You'll need to install a few Ruby gems to take advantage of Sass and Compass on
your local development machine.

### Mac

OSX comes with Ruby installed.

### Windows

Windows users should download and install [RubyInstaller](http://rubyinstaller.org/) for Windows.

### Linux

Linux users, you probably know how to get Ruby on your machine. Do that. Or follow the instructions in the PDF if you're not sure.

### Getting Help

If you have any questions regarding installing, they are most likely answered within the [Aurora Getting Started Manual](http://snugug.com/musings/installing-sass-and-compass-across-all-platforms)

## Gem installation

    sudo gem install compass toolkit compass-normalize sassy-buttons
